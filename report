# Uber Fares Dataset Analysis Report 📊

## Introduction 📝

The objective of this project is to analyze Uber Fares data to uncover patterns, trends, and operational metrics. Using Python for data preprocessing 🐍 and Power BI for visualization 📈, we aim to deliver actionable insights for ride distributions, time-based behaviors, and geographic ride density.

## Methodology 🛠️

### Data Collection 🗃️

* Dataset Source: Kaggle (Uber Fares Dataset).
* Loaded the dataset into Python (Pandas) 🐼 for initial inspection.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation 🧹

* Checked dataset structure, dimensions, and data types.
* Handled missing values by removing null entries.
* Converted `pickup_datetime` column to proper datetime format.
* Dropped unnecessary columns (e.g., `Unnamed: 0`, `key`).

### Feature Engineering 🏗️

* Extracted **hour**, **day**, **month**, **weekday** from `pickup_datetime`.
* Created a **Peak Hour Indicator** (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM as "Peak" ⏰; else "Off-Peak").
* Saved the enhanced dataset as `uber_fares_enhanced.csv` for Power BI.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍

* Generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, std deviation).
* Visualized fare distributions using:

  * 📊 Histograms
  * 📦 Box Plots
  * 📈 Line Charts (Fare vs Hour)
  * 🥧 Pie Charts (Peak vs Off-Peak)

### Power BI Dashboard Design 🖥️

* Imported the enhanced dataset into Power BI.
* Created visualizations:

  * 📋 **KPI Card** showing Total Trips.
  * 📈 **Line Chart** for Fare vs Hour.
  * 🥧 **Pie Chart** for Peak vs Off-Peak Trips.
  * 🗺️ **Map Visual** showing Pickup Locations.
  * 🎛️ **Slicers** for filtering by Passenger Count and Peak Hour.
* Applied professional layout with consistent color themes and borders 🎨.

### DAX Formulas (Used in Power BI) 🧮

* Calculated Total Fare: `Total Fare = SUM(uber_fares_enhanced[fare_amount])`
* Average Fare: `Average Fare = AVERAGE(uber_fares_enhanced[fare_amount])`
* Peak/Off-Peak Trip Counts using COUNTROWS and CALCULATE with filter conditions.

## Key Findings 🔑

* Majority of fares range between 💲5 and 💲20.
* Peak hours ⏰ show higher fare rates.
* Off-peak hours 🌙 have higher trip frequencies but lower fare amounts.
* Central urban areas 🏙️ exhibit the densest ride pickups.

## Recommendations 💡

* Optimize driver availability during peak hours to maximize fare revenues.
* Consider promotional discounts during off-peak periods to boost trip frequency.
* Focus marketing strategies on high-demand geographic zones.

## Conclusion 🏁

This project demonstrates how combining Python-based data preprocessing with Power BI visualization can derive valuable business insights. The dashboard offers interactive exploration of fare patterns, temporal trends, and ride distributions for informed decision-making.
